    During my years at Notre Dame, I gained knowledge and skills in mathematics and statistics, with a focus on computational applications, such as data mining and statistical programming (coursework in R, Python, C++, MATLAB, and SAS). 
    Outside of academics and research, I tutored Math to local high school students, was a TA for an introductory Accounting class, was a member of the Asian American Association, the Student International Business Council, and the Student Union Board.
