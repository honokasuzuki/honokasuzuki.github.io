  Hi, I'm Honoka.

  I'm a recent graduate of the University of Notre Dame with a background in Applied & Computational Statistics.
  With several internship experiences in data science and analytics, as well as research experience in quantitative psychology, I am passionate about the use of computational, data-driven approaches to tackle problems in our society.
  Put broadly, my career interests lie at the intersection of data and society - I aspire to become a research data scientist whose work impacts areas such as education and public health. 
  
  Proficient in R and Python, my projects have dealt with analytical techniques such as machine learning, text analysis, data visualization, statistical modeling, and data manipulation.
  
  In addition to my interests in data science and social science research, my personal hobbies and interests include healthy baking, fashion illustration, and traveling.

   - Outstanding Applied and Computational Mathematics and Statistics Major Award
   
   I was awarded in recognition as a graduating senior with the most outstanding scholarship, service, and leadership; selected from all ACMS majors in the graduating class of 2020.
   
   - Best Data Visualization Award, American Statistical Association Data Fest 2019 at Notre Dame
   
   I worked in a team of 3 during a data analysis competition (approximately 35 participants, 7 teams) organized by the ASA to tackle a large, complex, and surprise dataset over a weekend and presented a final deliverable to a panel of judges at the end of the competition.
   My teammates and I were awarded “best visual” for our Tableau dashboard that tracked athletes’ game-day external GPS movement, reported internal wellness, and hydration level.
