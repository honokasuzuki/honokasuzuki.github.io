    At Notre Dame, I studied mathematics and statistics, with a focus on computational applications, such as data mining and statistical programming (coursework in R, Python, C++, MATLAB, and SAS). 
    I additionally explored my interests in education through a minor, which led me to take courses in topics such as education policy and critical pedagogy. 
    Outside of academics and research, I tutored Math subjects to local high school students, was a TA for an introductory Accounting class, was a member of the Asian American Association, the Student International Business Council, and the Student Union Board.
