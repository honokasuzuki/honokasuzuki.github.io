    As an undergraduate research assistant, I had the priviledge to work alongside the graduate students and the director of the lab to gain important skills relevant to educational measurement research. 
    My tasks included data cleaning, running statistical analyses, conducting literature reviews, documenting research methods/findings, and providing peer feedback on academic manuscripts. 
    During my senior year, I wrote an honors thesis on the application of machine learning techniques to predict differences between learning outcomes (class grade, AP score, practice AP score) in AP Statistics classrooms to understand sources of variation across performance on distinct assessments.

    The Academic Technologies Lab is collaborating with Density (https://www.density.io/) to implement their occupancy sensor platform in various locations of Notre Dame's campus, with the ultimate goal of influencing student behavior by providing students with access to real-time occupancy data. My role in this project was to conduct an internal study to assess the accuracy of the sensors placed in the dining halls. The project involved technical tasks such as data collection, data cleaning, statistical reliability analysis, and creating data visualizations. 
    In addition, I regularly met with the dining hall staff and representatives from Density to obtain data, ask questions, receive feedback, and report findings.
